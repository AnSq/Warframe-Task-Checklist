# Warframe Task Checklist Web App

A simple, client-side web application to help Warframe players track their daily, weekly, and other in-game tasks, built with Vite for optimized performance.

This is a soft fork of [warframe-tools/Task-Checklist](https://github.com/warframe-tools/Task-Checklist).
The live version of this branch is deployed at [ansq.github.io/Warframe-Task-Checklist](https://ansq.github.io/Warframe-Task-Checklist/).

## Description

This tool provides checklists for common recurring activities in Warframe. It saves your progress directly in your browser's local storage, automatically resets daily and weekly tasks based on UTC time, and offers a few customization options. The application is built using HTML, CSS (with Tailwind CSS via CDN for rapid styling), vanilla JavaScript, and is processed with Vite for an optimized production build.
